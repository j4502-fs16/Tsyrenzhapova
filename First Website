<p1>After graduating from the Missouri School of Journalism in 2010 with an undergraduate degree in Magazine Writing, I moved back home, to Almaty, Kazakhstan.  During my 5+ years there as a Media Program Coordinator at Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan, I designed and implemented several grant-making-strategies aimed to foster press freedom and media professionalism in a restrictive media environment.</p1>
<br> </br>
<p2>I co-authored the Mapping Digital Media report, Kazakhstanâ€™s first internationally recognized research on the current state of the media, published in English, Kazakh and Russian.</p2>
<br> </br>
<p3>At my spare time, I wrote feature stories for the Transitions Online Magazine as their Kazakhstan correspondent.</p3>
<br> </br>
<p4>Having traveled to 25+ countries in five years, now I am back in Columbia, Missouri, to my second home away from home. As I work toward my M.A. in Convergence Journalism, I will be posting my most recent multimedia projects, produced on a weekly basis.</p4>
<br> </br>
<p5>Stay tuned!</p5>
