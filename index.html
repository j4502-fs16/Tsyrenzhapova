<p> I have been taught to write in a way that brings readers delight. To captivate their attention, there has to be a surprise as if "a duck walks into a bar..."</p>

<p>After graduating from the <a href="https://journalism.missouri.edu/">Missouri School of Journalism</a> in 2010 with an undergraduate degree in Magazine Writing, I moved back home, to Almaty, Kazakhstan.  During my 5+ years there as a Media Program Coordinator at Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan, I designed and implemented several grant-making-strategies aimed to foster press freedom and media professionalism in a restrictive media environment.</p>

<p>I co-authored the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/mapping-digital-media-kazakhstan">Mapping Digital Media Report</a>, Kazakhstanâ€™s first internationally recognized research on the current state of the media, published in English, Kazakh and Russian.</p>

<p>At my spare time, I wrote feature stories for the <a href="http://www.tol.org/client/search/?search=dariya">Transitions Online Magazine</a> as their Kazakhstan correspondent.</p>

<p>Having traveled to 25+ countries in five years, now I am back in Columbia, Missouri, to my second home away from home. As I work toward my M.A. in Convergence Journalism, I will be posting my most recent multimedia projects, produced on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! Hope you visit my <a href="file:///Users/dariyatsyrenzhapova/Desktop/Tsyrenzhapova/Multimedia.html">Multimedia Portfolio</a> often!</p>
